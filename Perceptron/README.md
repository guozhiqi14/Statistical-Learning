# Perceptron   

* When dataset is linearly separable, Perceptron has infinite number of solutions and based on different init values and stochastic orderï¼Œsolution will be different.
* When it's linearly separable, it can be proved that algorithm is converged. 
* When it't not linearly separable, we can guaranteen algorithm's convergence and iteration results would be violating.
